ðŸš¨ Why We Use a Smoke Detection Device

Fire Safety

The primary purpose is to detect smoke early, which usually indicates a fire.

Early detection allows people to evacuate safely and reduce property damage.

Prevent Accidents

Smoke detection helps prevent dangerous situations, especially in homes, offices, or factories.

It warns before fire spreads, minimizing risk to life and equipment.

Automation & Alerts

The system can automatically trigger alarms (LED/Buzzer) without human intervention.

Advanced systems can even send notifications to mobile devices or security systems.

Environmental Monitoring

MQ-2 sensors can detect smoke and certain gases, helping monitor air quality.

Cost-Effective & Easy to Implement

Using Arduino and MQ-2 makes it a low-cost solution for fire detection.

Suitable for educational projects and small-scale applications.
